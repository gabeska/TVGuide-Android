# TVGuide-Android
Android TV EPG app for Dutch TV (data from tv_grab_nl_py), with custom queries

Prototype TV Electronic Programme Guide app that answers the question: "might there be anything interesting on TV for me (to record)?"
instead of the question "what programme is on channel X at time Y tomorrow" (as most EPG's do)

uses a public dropbox folder as a data source, updates (when on WiFi) twice daily.

public dropbox folder should be updated from MongoDB by the web version of this app, not active right now due to hardware issues
